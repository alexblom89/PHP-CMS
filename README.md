Alex Blom - 867295

The website located at https://lamp.computerstudi.es/~Alex_S867295/Assignment2/index.php allows users to register and login to
an admin site, from which they will eventually be able to create their own public site pages (similar to wordpress), manage the users 
with administration access to their site, and upload a logo.
