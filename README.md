# COMP1006 Intro to Web Programming, Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment is to create a simple Content Management System, with secure user registration and login. The user can login to an admin-only dashboard and create/edit their own public site pages, manage which users have administration access, and upload a logo.

This project was created with PHP and a MySQL database, and styled with HTML and Bootstrap CSS.
